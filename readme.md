  About me
</h2>

<p align="center">
  I'm a college student 📝majoring in Computer Science 💻🔬. I started coding in 6th grade when I was introduced to 2D games in Love2D. Since then, I live, breath, and think in programming terms 24/7. Now, I have fun creating 3D games in Unreal Engine, building full stack applications and open-source packages/libraries for others to use, and wondering when I'm finally going to get a good night's sleep.
