<h1 align="center">Hey there! I'm Brandon Kong ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>

I'm Brandon, a passionate software engineer/game developer currently studying Computer Science at DePaul University. I find myself exploring new technologies and learning new concepts every day. I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge.

I'm also a research assistant as part of the Motorola Solutions Foundation Program, where I work on Bioinformatics in the context of
brain stem nuclei segmentation using machine learning.

I am humbled to have been programming for over 6 years, and I've 
had the opportunity to work on some popular game titles, accumulating
millions of plays.
