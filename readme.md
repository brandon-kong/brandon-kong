<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Brandon Kong ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>

I'm a software engineer and game developer studying Computer Science at DePaul University. I enjoy exploring new technologies and building creative projects.

As a research assistant through the Motorola Solutions Foundation Program, I work on brain stem nuclei localization using machine learning in the field of bioinformatics.

With over 7 years of experience, I've contributed to widely played games and helped startups bring ideas to life through robust applications.

</p>

Iâ€™ve worked with **Java**, **Python**, **C++**, **JS/TS**, and **Lua**, and have experience with **C#**, **Rust**, **Go**, **PHP**, and **Scala**. Iâ€™ve also built projects using frameworks like **Django**, **ASP.NET**, **Flask**, **FastAPI**, **Next.js**, **GoFiber**, and **Express**.

I'm especially interested in user authentication and building secure systems.
