  About me
</h2>

<p align="center">
  I'm a college student 📝majoring in Computer Science 💻🔬. I started coding in 6th grade when I was introduced to 2D games in Love2D. Since then, I live, breath, and think in programming terms 24/7. Now, I have fun creating 3D games in Unreal Engine, building full stack applications and open-source packages/libraries for others to use, and wondering when I'm finally going to get a good night's sleep.

  <p>Faceade is one of many personal projects of mine that involves face detection software. Basically, it's a multiplayer web-based drawing game that was
      designed to be played with friends. Instead of using a mouse to draw on the canvas, players must draw using their nose, and others can watch how silly the drawer looks! More information about the project's stack is on the repository's <code>readme.md</code>
